## Abstract
A rapid transition of the dark energy equation of state parameter $w$ at a transition redshift $z_t<0.1$ from $w\simeq -1$ at $z>z_t$ to $w<-1$ at $z<z_t$ can lead to a higher value of the Hubble constant while closely mimicking a \plcdm form of the comoving distance  $r(z)=\int_0^z\frac{dz'}{H(z')}$ for $z>z_t$. Such a transition avoids the discontinuity of $H(z)$ suggested in previous studies and thus does not require a step in the Pantheon Hubble diagram which is strongly constrained. We demonstrate that such a ultra low $z$ abrupt feature of $w(z)$ provides a better fit to cosmological data compared to smooth late time deformations of $H(z)$. The strongly present day phantom dark energy behavior implied by this class of models hints towards a rapid approach of a Big Rip singularity.
