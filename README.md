## Abstract
A rapid transition of the dark energy equation of state parameter ![$w$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24w%24) at a transition redshift ![$z_t<0.1$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24z_t%20%3C%200.1%24) from ![$w\simeq -1$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24w%5Csimeq%20-1%24) at ![$z>z_t$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24z%20%3E%20z_t%24) to ![$w<-1$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24w%20%3C%20-1%24) at ![$z<z_t$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24z%20%3C%20z_t%24) can lead to a higher value of the Hubble constant while closely mimicking a \plcdm form of the comoving distance  ![$r(z)=\int_0^z\frac{dz'}{H(z')}$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24r(z)%3D%5Cint_0%5E%7Bz%7D%5Cfrac%7Bdz'%7D%7BH(z')%7D%24) for ![$z>z_t$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24z%20%3E%20z_t%24). Such a transition avoids the discontinuity of ![$H(z)$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24H(z)%24) suggested in previous studies and thus does not require a step in the Pantheon Hubble diagram which is strongly constrained. We demonstrate that such a ultra low ![$z$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24z%24) abrupt feature of ![$w(z)$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24w(z)%24) provides a better fit to cosmological data compared to smooth late time deformations of ![$H(z)$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24H(z)%24). The strongly present day phantom dark energy behavior implied by this class of models hints towards a rapid approach of a Big Rip singularity.
